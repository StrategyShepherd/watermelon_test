Ideally a URL shortner  should be able to do two thigns

// given that we can't process all URL lengths//
Ideally we should probarly look at limiting the size of the request that goes inside of the API
Ideally we can do this server-side
Create a URl Alais
/// Ideally we could implement this in-memory, but ideally we extend the creation of database to having a new table /// with some sort  of hashfed value
// at this stage we don't need to deal with hash collisions at the meoment
/// but we can introduce behaviour such as
/// expriation dates // creation time and created by authors
/// we'd also need a library / fucntion to generate short url, at the moment we can do a simple hash fucntion to retridve
/// once created we'd need to mark this in a whitelist of sorts(can filter this out, in the event of hash colission
Delete a URL Alais
/// this should be a db call basically// check if not in use by any other resoruce
// and then delete a URL mapping, allowing that value to be used for another alias

/// Redirect al lrequests to an alias to the full URL should happen at the api-level scope
/// Ideally we can return a 302 or a 301 as respone
